# Preface

> First thing's first I love all my niggas - YG

Strictly speaking, this book is about statistical ideas, data, and how a casual comfort with the two can be practically beneficial and intellectually satisfying. And is one individual's humble attempt to help his big brother gain both of those out comes in the context of a sales career and hip hop. If you just want the math and don't care to hear my gibberish commentary about the title you can skip this.

Let's address the obvious, the use of that ever so troubling word nigga. Apart from the deliberate shock it's intended to invoke upon potential readers, its use here encapsulates the intended audience in far less words then would other wise be necessary. And so you are probably asking, just who might this audience of _niggas_ be and am I included?[^1]

By niggas I mean, **the subset of Americans for whom this country was not built for, but if not for them this country would not have been built.** 

This includes our Asian niggas whose ancestors ~~greatly helped~~ build the railroads that facilitated the great expanse of this nation out west. The ~~native~~ American niggas whose ancestors where given smallpox blankets in exchange for their land.  The original California niggas whose children where recently offered a wall to help keep them out of the land their ancestors died trying to protect but was eventually stolen from them. The middle of American piss poor white niggas, who continue to work tirelessly performing jobs that enable the necessary infrastructure of this great nation yet enjoy none of its luxuries.  The female niggas of every ethnic decent that have been denied every form of equality, even to the point of being denied the right to be treated as unequal as the black man. And of course the black man, the nigga you was probably thinking of when you read the title. It goes without saying what THAT niggas ancestors have contributed.  

I write this book for their children. Those children in particular who still have yet to benefit, take advantage of  or be given equal access to the spoils of these contributions.

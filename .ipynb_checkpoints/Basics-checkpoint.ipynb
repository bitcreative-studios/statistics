    "Eveery day we are confronted with situations with uncertain outcomes, and must make decisions based on incomplete data...while there are many questions that are out the realm of statistics (i.e., _the number of contributing factors is too large and ambigiously connected_) there are many other instances wher it can **help extract maximum knowledge from information given, and clearly spell out what we know and what we don't know**. Without statistics, the interpretation of data cna quickly becom massively flawed. Similarly, using the wrong tests can also lead to erroneous results, thus statistics facilates:\n",
